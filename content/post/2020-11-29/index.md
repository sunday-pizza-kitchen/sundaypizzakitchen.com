It is the last Sunday of November. We decided on taking a break from making
pizza this weekend due to the Thanksgiving holiday. There is enough food
that gets eaten over the four days and making pizza on top of that was a
bit much. I will instead write up about using the leftover dough from last
weekend.

I was planning on making tacos for dinner Monday night but I kept thinking
about the dough that was sitting in the fridge. I wasn't really in the mood
for pizza a second day in a row. Cheese sticks dipped in pizza sauce sounded
good though. I don't know how that is any different, but for some reason, it
is for me.

I pulled out the one container of dough at around 5 o'clock and let it
sit on the counter. Out of the fridge, the dough ball was looking like this:

I left it on the counter for 45 minutes and then tried to stretch it out.
It was too loose and when I went to lift it off the counter, it sagged so
much that the bottom part of the dough never left the counter. It had
lost its structure and just was not workable at this point.

Notice how the edge of the dough at the bottom is very thick but then right
above it is is so thin that holes have appeared. I gave up on this dough
ball and tossed it in the garbage bin.

I had one dough ball left. This time I tried something completely different.
I pulled the dough ball out of the fridge and immediately placed it on the
cutting board. It was too rigid to stretch by hand so I instead used a rolling
pin until it got to here:

I then put on the leftover cheese in the very precise amount of
everything-left-in-the-bag, drizzled some olive oil on top, and then sprinkled
it with a bit of garlic salt.

I slid the cheese sticks into the oven and after a few minutes, it looked
like this:

Large air bubbles were forming. I probably should have used the docker on the
dough when doing this. I grabbed a long knife and punctured as many bubbles
as I could. I also forgot to remove the upper rack which is never good when
taking photos.

I flipped the cheese bread around when I saw the back side baking faster than
the front. I then pulled it out of the oven when it was looking like this:

It was looking good. It was smelling good. My mouth was watering. Instead
of cutting it with the pizza cutter or using a knife, I tried out these
new scissors that have appeared in our kitchen drawers:

These worked out very well. Especially with the thin crust on these cheese
sticks. There was no leftover sauce from Sunday so I pulled out a jar of
Classico pizza sauce that sits in the pantry waiting to be used in moments
like this. I heated up the sauce in the microwave until it got to the
temperature of splattering and dipped in the first slice:

I've had mixed results making cheese sticks in the past but these were a
winner. I called Terri down for her to try some and she said these were the
best so far.

It is good to know that cheese sticks can be made by overdeveloped
dough when rolled out straight from the fridge. This also gives me some
ideas for later when doing a thinner style of pizza.
