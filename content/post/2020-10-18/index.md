It is the third Saturday of October. Pizza day is normally on a Sunday but this
week Erika came down for a visit and Terri asked if I would like to make some
pizza. I cannot pass up on an opportunity to make pizza so this week was a
Saturday instead.

Everyone wanted pizza so I increased the dough recipe up to 1,500 g to get
around nine dough balls. I didn't have enough all-purpose flour and the last
100 g was bread flour instead. I didn't notice any difference in the final
product.

I tried to weigh the dough before portioning them into balls but the dough blob
was too big to fit on the scale. It would keep flopping over the sides before I
could get a reading. This was the blob after cutting off the first ball:

I portioned them into 275 g each but the last ball ended up being 15 g short.
I'll use the smaller one for practicing my acrobatic skills. I grouped the
dough into two different shifts. The first one had four dough balls that were
left out on the counter and covered with a damp towel:

The remaining dough balls were placed back into the fridge for a hour before
allowing them to come up to room temperature:

This works really well to make sure the dough balls are in a workable state and
not completely blown out for the pizzas being made later in the day. When I was
a younger kid, I worked at two different [pizza
shops](https://thedoughroller.com/) and I cannot remember how dough was managed
throughout the day in this way. I should have paid more attention to what was
going on.

The first pizza out of the oven is always a cheese pizza to make sure
everything is tasting correctly:

That one could have been stretched more and the shape was a little off but it
sure did taste good. The rest of the pizzas requested were either pepperoni
or cheese. I made seven pizzas and some cheese sticks overall. We had this
carry-out order for Ben to take the pizza back to his room:

I was trying to talk someone into making a delivery and then asking for a tip.

With the following pizza, I got distracted and forgot to rotate it around half
way through cooking:

The crust at the top is a bit overdone and the crust on the bottom could have
used some more baking time. Even with the convection bake setting turned on,
those pizzas need to be moved around.

I ran out of the Boar's Head pepperoni for Zach's pizza and opened up a
new pack of Mama Mary's. I've never used that brand before. I picked that up
for the simple reason that the grocery store was out of the Boar's Head
brand. Zach said they had a spicier taste to them. I'll give them a try
next weekend and see if I like them or not.

The cheese sticks were covered in olive oil and made with the remaining cheese
that was left. Which wasn't much. I started cleaning up after that and when I
went to grab a cheese stick to eat, they were all gone. So I don't know how
they turned out. Apparently they needed some more cheese.

After pizza eating was done, we played a game of [Cover Your A$$ets](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121193/cover-your-assets) and I guess I didn't cover them well enough
because I didn't win. Its a fun enough and casual game that is good to play.
