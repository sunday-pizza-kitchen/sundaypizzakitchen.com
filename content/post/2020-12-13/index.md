It is the second Sunday of December. I was by myself today so I planned on
using some of this special pizza yeast we have sitting in the cabinet:

![Yeast Front](yeast_front.tn.jpg)

Terri was the first one to find yeast back on the shelves during the early
weeks of the pandemic and bought a whole bunch of everything--the standard
active dry yeast, the rapid rise yeast, and this special yeast for making
pizza. I haven't used it yet and its going to expire in a few months
so today seemed like a good day to try this out.

My phone kept pestering me to visit breadworld.com as I was taking this photo
because of the QR code. I finally went to visit the site while writing this
entry. Well, I went to breadworld.com. It sort of just hangs and it feels like
[the system is down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP0cOv71Gxk). I started
poking around and its DNS entry points to an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance,
but if you use www&period;breadworld.com, it points to an AWS load balancer in
us-east-1. The page at www.breadworld.com/pizza returns a 301 response, moved
permanently, with a forwarding address of fleischmannsyeast.com. A blanket
redirect. How disappointing.

The next packet down has a recipe:

A 30 minute pizza. I was skeptical but figured it was worth a try. I was so
skeptical that I didn't invest the time to make a sauce. I also kept the
cheese sealed in its wrapper until I had a viable dough on the peel.

A range of 1¾ to 2¼ cups of flour is quite large. I picked 2 cups, measured its
weight (which was 280 g) and then rounded up to 300 g. I find it funny when
recipes on the Internet list metric conversions but do not have the courage
to round.

I then dumped in the entire yeast packet. That is a lot of yeast:

I followed the rest as-is but weighed out the water. That was 150 g after
rounding. The water is 50% of the flour weight which is much less than the
65% for the [Pinello dough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnvQBhXh3A).
After four minutes of kneading, it looked like this:

![Dough Ball](dough_ball.tn.jpg)

The outer skin of the dough starts forming a hardened crust quickly so when
this is ready, just keep on going. The final measurement on the dough was
498 g which is too much for a single pizza. I split that into two separate
dough balls.

The dough was too tight for me to work by hand. I stretched it out the best
that I could and then used a rolling pin. When it got to the desired
thinness, it looked like this:

I then cubed up some cheese, spread out some
[Classico](https://www.classico.com/product/00041129396407/traditional-pizza-sauce)
pizza sauce, and topped it with some pepperoni and thick rings of onion. I
also pinched around the edge of the pizza for some flair.

And straight out of the oven:

The first slice:

I was quite surprised. It was a taste that I was not expecting. A taste
like a Pizza Hut Thin & Crispy. In my childhood, before I discovered the
greatness that is [Ponzetti's](https://www.facebook.com/ponzettis/), the
Thin & Crispy pizza was the only pizza I would eat. And I loved it.

In a few places it was a little doughy and felt undercooked. If you look
closely in the picture above, you can see a gummy line of dough in the
crust. Out of habit, I cooked it at 550°F when the recipe called for a longer
cook at 425°F. I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but worth trying
next time.

The signature feature of a Thin & Crispy is the air pockets that hold their
shape and crisp up nicely:

I was expecting this pizza be boring and bland at best. I was prepared for
a disappointment but this pizza was actually quite good. If you are looking
for a New York style pizza, do not follow this recipe. For something that
has that Pizza Hut Thin & Crispy feel, give it a try. I want to explore this
more in the future to try and get my own Thin & Crispy,
[but better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DZA85l868c).
