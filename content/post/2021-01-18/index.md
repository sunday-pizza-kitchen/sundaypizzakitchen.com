It is the third Monday of January. I asked Niles if he wanted to come over
for pizza this Sunday but he invited us over to his place for pizza and
egg rolls instead. I can't say no to that.

Today was a holiday and I had some pizza sauce to use up. Why not have some pizza
again today and make myself a pie? Actually, I had pizza on Saturday too. We
went up to [Pub Dog](https://pubdog.com/) in Westminster and this is what I got:

So today was going to be three days in a row with pizza. Sounds good to me.

Ken's brother, Mike, has been making Detroit-style pizzas lately and has
been sending me photos of his delicious work. I asked him what [pan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FY5UFCI/ref=cm_sw_r_u_apa_fabc_p8VUFbS2K7RK4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) he was using and I then asked for one as a Christmas present. Here it is:

I've never had an actual Detroit-style pizza so I don't know what it is
supposed to taste like. Mike pointed me to [Buddy's](https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/buddys-cheese-pizza-2056611)
recipe. I already have sauce and Wisconsin brick cheese isn't something found
at my local Giant. I decided to follow the dough recipe and just top it with
the sauce and mozzarella sitting in the fridge.

I measured out the flour by weight and that came out to 400 grams. The water was
340 grams. That is a lot of water so I could already tell this was going to be
a really sticky dough. I planned on using the stand mixer today but in
an absent-minded moment, I started combining the dough in a regular bowl.

At this point I transferred the dough to the mixer bowl and this is how
sticky the dough was:

The recipe says to run it in the mixer for eight minutes and to check regularly
to see if the dough is sticky. I already knew that was going to be the case.
It said to add more flour a spoonful at a time and I added about four spoons.
It was still quite gooey at the end:

The pan pizza dough recipe that I followed some time ago came out looking
like this too. Buddy's recipe seems to indicate that it should be a lot firmer
but that would have been a lot of added flour. I decided to use it as-is and see
how it goes. In to the bowl for a rest:

After thirty minutes, I cut the dough ball in half and placed one of them
into the pan which was lightly oiled and sprinkled with some oregano and
garlic salt. The dough was nice and spongy at this time but I wasn't able
to stretch the whole way. I covered it and let it sit for another twenty
minutes. It was then [showtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9W4jEzB90c):

I got too excited and started to make a mistake by putting the sauce on first.
I quickly corrected my error, placed on all of the cheese, and then put
down two lines of sauce:

That went into a 450°F oven for fifteen minutes with a 180° rotation half
way through baking. Here is how it looked straight out of the oven:

It took me some time to free it from the pan but nowhere near as long as it
took me the first time with the cast iron skillet. The pizza has some lovely
char on the side:

And the underbelly:

The pizza was good for my first attempt but it needs improvement. I put on way
too much sauce. The top stripe there could have been called Lake Ontario and
the bottom stripe could have been Lake Erie. Whatever amount I think is
correct, I just need to cut that by half. And the dough was a bit underdone.
It was a little doughy but I didn't find any uncooked parts. It probably could
have used another minute or two in the oven if the cheese could survive.

That was fun. I'll be doing this again.
