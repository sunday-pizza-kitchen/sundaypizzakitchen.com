It is the fourth Sunday of February. It also the last day of the month
and a rainy one at that. I was by myself today for pizza and that is always a 
great time for an experiment. I wanted to see if I could make a 
[Ledo](https://ledopizza.com/) style pizza. Thin, square, cheesy--what is there
not to love?

The sauce is the easy part. That is sold at the local Giant grocery store:

The only problem with the sauce is that it is a huge bottle. It does say
that it is their "pizza and pasta" sauce. I've never had their pasta but
I guess I'll make some up this week and see how it tastes with the Ledo
sauce. I have a lot to use up. 

Ledo's advertises that they use smoked provolone cheese on their pizza. 
I didn't get fancy on this one. I picked up the pre-packaged provolone 
slices that I use for sandwiches and 
[cheesesteaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwZzZ2I5XWY).

For the dough, I decided to use up the second packet of the special 
[pizza yeast](../2020-12-13/) that I have. It expires in March, so if I'm 
going to use it, now is the time. I changed up the dough recipe and substituted 
butter for the oil. I asked Google what I should do and Tom Lehmann said to 
use [20% more butter than oil](https://pizzatoday.com/oils-affect-dough/). 
That would be Tom Lehmann the Dough Doctor and not the other 
[Tom Lehmann](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy).

So, 20% more of three tablespoons is when it is time to pull out the scale. 
I put on one of the half-sticks of butter, which is four tablespoons, and 
got 57 g which is close enough to 60 g.

Three tablespoons is 75% of a half-stick which is 45 g and that is what I
measured out. I totally forgot to add the 20% back on. This is why I find
it so valuable to take notes.

It did say 45 on that scale. When I went to take the photo, it dropped 
down to 44. Close enough. I also weighed out the other dry goods this 
time around. Sugar came out to 8 g and salt was 5 g. 

I used the stand mixer today and combined everything except the butter. 
I waited until it started looking like this to add the butter:

It took some time for the butter to incorporate. Next time I'll soften 
it up some before adding it to the dough. It was looking soft but it
wasn't soft enough. I let the mixer knead the dough for four minutes 
after the butter was worked in. 

I then split the dough into two equal halves. I bagged one of them and 
put it in the freezer for later. The other one I rolled it out into a 
rectangular shape until it was thin:

Why not use the Detroit-style pan for this pizza too? I first measured 
to see that the dough was stretched enough:

I then placed the dough in the pan. I trimmed the crust where it was too
long and then shaped the crust in areas that were lacking. I should have 
made that upper right corner look better.

I let the dough sit in the pan for ten minutes while I went to work on 
the pepperoni. There was no "real" sliced pepperoni to be found at the Giant 
today. There was plenty of turkey pepperoni and I just cannot 
be tempted by that. I instead bought this stick:

![Pepperoni Stick](pep_stick.tn.jpg)

Ledo pizza has thicker style pepperoni so I thought this would work 
well. I sliced up enough for one pepperoni per slice and dressed up the
pizza. Yes, I did have too much fun with that cheese jigsaw puzzle:

![Dressed Up](dressed_up.tn.jpg)

It went into a 450Â°F oven for 15 minutes and it came out looking like this:

It definitely has that Ledo look:

And the underbelly was nicely browned:

This came out way better than I was expecting and it really felt like an
actual Ledo pizza. The crust was good considering that it was a no-rise
pizza crust recipe. Next time I'm going to try to use the standard
dough recipe and see how that fares with this style. I do think that 
using butter instead of oil is key.
