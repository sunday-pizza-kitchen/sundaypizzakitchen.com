It is the fourth Saturday in April. I am again making pizza on a Saturday
afternoon because I have plans for Sunday. Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary
and we are going out for a nice dinner. No need to spoil my appetite by
having a heavy pizza lunch. That is something I can instead do for today.

Ken has been making some pizza lately and he is also using [Frank
Pinello's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnvQBhXh3A) dough recipe. He has
been using the dough after a one hour rise and has been saying that
the crust in the pizza is too dense. I've never actually tried the recipe as a
same-day dough so I thought that would be a fun experiment to try for today. The planned schedule was:

- 12:00pm - turn on the oven, start making the dough
- 12:30pm - finish the dough, let it rise on the counter
- 1:30pm - finish the rise, start making the pizza
- 2:00pm - done eating and head out to MicroCenter

I compared the recipe as Frank said it in the video, to the copy on the
[Munchies web site](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z489pw/pizza-dough),
and to the [copy that I have](https://sundaypizzakitchen.com/software/). First up was 3½ cups of flour:

![Flour](flour.tn.jpg)

That came in at 495 g today which is close to the 500 g that I have written
down.

What wasn't close was the yeast. On the Munchies web site it says 1 teaspoon
of active dry yeast. In the video he says 10 grams. This is a teaspoon:

![Yeast](yeast.tn.jpg)

Ten grams is more than a single packet of yeast. I was using one teaspoon for
the overnight dough and that worked well, and maybe even too well, because I
ended up reducing it to half a teaspoon. A one hour rise probably needs more
punch so I was thinking that maybe the 10 grams is more appropriate for today's
pizza. I'm not sure but it was worth a try. I opened up two yeast packets
and measured out the 10 grams.

I then measured out 1½ cups of water and this came out to 342 grams.

![Water](water.tn.jpg)

My notes has 325 grams. I'm not sure which one is more correct. I kept the
1½ cups of water without any adjustments.

There is a salt discrepancy in the recipe. In the video he says 1½ tablespoons
but the web site says 1 teaspoon. This is not the first recipe that I've tried
where this error was made and that difference in salt can ruin the batch.
Someone in the YouTube comments stated that 1 teaspoon is the correct amount
and that is also the amount I have in my notes. I think he simply was reading
off the wrong line on a cue card somewhere. That weighed out to 8 grams and my
notes rounds that up to 10.

Olive oil is 1½ tablespoons in the video and 2 tablespoons on the web site.
That difference isn't going to be disastrous. I weighed out 2 tablespoons and
got 25 grams. My notes says 5 grams. I have no clue why that is so far off. I
guess that I forgot the 2 and only wrote down the 5.

I combined all the ingredients and mixed it in the bowl until it looked like
this:

![Knead Before](knead_before.tn.jpg)

When mixing, the dough starts out feeling dry at first, but it gets stickier
the more that you start working it. It is tempting to put water in at the very
beginning when it is dry, and then it is tempting to put flour in when it gets
sticky. At this point I took the dough out of the bowl, started kneading, and
set the timer for 10 minutes. The stickiness will go away as the dough
tightens up during kneading. I only add flour as a last resort when it is
too sticky to knead. It ends up looking quite smooth when kneading is
complete.

I oiled a bowl, oiled the dough, and put the dough in the bowl:

I finally found my dish towels. They were in a pile of other cleaned laundry
items sitting on my bedroom dresser. I think they have been there for six
months or so. It's obvious that I haven't been [hitchhiking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ktg1kO7Z5Y) lately. They got put to good use today:

After one hour, the dough looked like this:

![Rise After](rise_after.tn.jpg)

It expanded quite a bit. Total weight was 860 grams so I split the dough into
three 280 gram balls and threw out the excess. One is for today, one is
for the fridge, and one is for the freezer. I placed the for today on the
cutting board:

I then used my fingers to press out the dough as much as possible until it
got to here:

Ken said he was using a rolling pin so I decided to do the same. I stretched
it out until it got close to being 12 inches in diameter:

Today I'm keeping it simple. A cheese pizza with 90 g of cubed mozzarella
cheese and [Ledo's sauce](https://ledopizza.com/shop/ledo-pizza-sauce/):

![Pizza Before](pizza_before.tn.jpg)

After baking in the oven for seven and a half minutes, it came out looking
like this:

![Pizza After](pizza_after.tn.jpg)

I got a little sloppy on the cheese coverage but I'll just use a bit more
next time. The crust didn't develop any bubbles and didn't have any charring
but that is probably what happens when using a rolling pin. The
dough did have a nice chew and looked great from the side:

![Pizza Side](pizza_side.tn.jpg)

I was actually expecting it to be thinner than that but it puffed up a bit in
the oven. It didn't taste dense to me and was rather pleasant to eat. Terri
came down at this time, had a few slices, and was also happy with the result.
She also took this photo:

This turned out to be a good pizza. Letting the dough sit overnight does
improve the taste by an order of magnitude but if you want to make some
pizza, and make it quick, this works. Using the 10 grams of yeast was
probably the right call. Maybe it would have been too dense at 1 teaspoon.
I might try that next time but make two doughs in case the first one doesn't
work.

After pizza, Terri and I went to MicroCenter and I stumbled across this:

![Scale](scale.tn.jpg)

I'm not really sure why I found a mini digital kitchen scale at MicroCenter,
but I've been meaning to pick up up for some time now. I finally got one.
I just didn't expect to find it there.
