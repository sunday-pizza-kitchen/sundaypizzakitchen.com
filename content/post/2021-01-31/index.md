It is the last Sunday of January. We finally got some snow around here:

I invited Niles and Little T over for some pizza today but I wasn't sure
if they were going to come over due to the snow. A lot of the neighborhood kids
were sledding down the hill behind our house. This was the first time in
a year and a half that we had enough snow for that. Apparently, Little T
doesn't like playing in the snow while it is snowing, so he preferred pizza
time instead.

I made enough dough for three pizzas today. The dough was looking really
smooth today when I pulled it out of the beer fridge:

As I was moving stuff around to setup the mise en place, I noticed that
the flour container has a blister just like the olive oil squirt
bottle:

The electric griddle has now taken down two plastic containers. I was trying
to be careful but I guess I was not careful enough. This is a new griddle
bought within the past six months or so. Now I know why the previous griddle
had a large plastic bezel around the entire thing.

Ken's brother, Mike, sent over pictures yesterday from his adventures in
baking pizza. He mentioned that he used this
[pizza sauce recipe](http://www.thehomepizzeria.com/recipes/san-marzano-tomato-pizza-sauce-recipe/).
I figured I would try it out too.

The author of the sauce recipe does not like canned tomato liquid. Let it
drain for an hour? I'm too impatient for that. I dumped the tomatoes into
a colander and hosed them down with tap water. I cut out the stems as
instructed and mashed them up with a fork. I couldn't find the potato
masher and I tried my hands but that was squishy and taking too long.
I gave up and put the sauce in the stand mixer using the whisk attachment.
It combined well but was still a bit chunky:

Rumor has is that [Grotto](https://grottopizza.com/) uses white colby cheese
on their pizza. I couldn't find that at the store, but why not try with
some standard colby jack. I put in about 30% of the colby jack to 70% of the
part-skim milk mozzarella. I cubed the cheese today instead of shredding:

I was ready to go with the first pizza when Niles and the kid showed up.
I assembled the first cheese pizza quickly while we were chatting:

After I launched the pizza, Niles asked what the agenda was for today. I
told him I changed something in the pizza but it was up to him to find out
what that was. After seven minutes:

He quickly noticed that the cheese blend was new and that something was
different with the sauce. The colby jack added a distinctive flavor and it
was one that I've tasted in other pizzas before. According to my taste buds, Grotto
does have this cheese, but in what quantities I do not know. Niles said that the
sauce tasted too basic. That something was missing.

Time for some toppings--pepperoni, onion, and some banana peppers. I made the
onion slices thicker today but not [MOD Pizza](https://modpizza.com/) thick.
This pizza looked great before it even hit the oven:

This pizza needed an extra minute to bake completely:

This was a delicious pizza. This combination of toppings always works well
but for some reason it tasted even better today. Two pizzas baked and no
slices left over.

I was going to make a pizza for Zach but he had to leave before it was baking
time. Ben got the last pizza instead. The always classic pepperoni:

Three pizzas later and there wasn't much sauce left:

The author of the sauce recipe was against using a blender claiming that
chopping up the tomato seeds leads to a slightly bitter taste. I've also heard from
a few sources to completely drain the liquid in the can because that also
contributes to a slightly bitter taste. That is probably why the recipe called
for a full hour of draining. After following these instructions there
was only enough sauce for three pizzas. When I keep the liquid and blend
everything together, I can fill a full 32 oz mason jar which is enough for two
weekends of six pizzas each.

I think it is just easier to add honey or sugar.
