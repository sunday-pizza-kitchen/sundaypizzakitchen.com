It is the second Sunday of January. Mehdi and Zineb came over and they wanted
us to try some tuna pizza. Yes, you heard that correctly. Pizza with tuna. We
are talking canned tuna here--not sushi tuna. When Mehdi first asked me where
to get a good tuna pizza around here I thought he was trying to punk me.
Apparently this is a popular pizza in Europe. I would have never known. I am
more of a [bacon and trucks](https://youtu.be/uu_BM2geHoU?t=433) kind of guy.

They brought over some ingredients with them:

On the far left is some fresh mozzarella. Then some parmesan, dry cured
olives, pre-shredded blend of provolone and asiago,
homemade pizza sauce, canned tuna, pre-shredded mozzarella, and
pepperoni. I was responsible for making the dough and stretching it out.
Mehdi took care of the rest.

We always have to start with a cheese pizza. Here is Chef Mehdi putting down
some parmesan on the pizza crust:

After adding the four cheese blend it looked like this:

I stretched it a little too thin towards the center. In the oven some cheese
lava punched through the crust and formed a small rock island on the pizza
stone. It was a little messy but the overall pizza came out good enough:

I am not a fan of pre-shredded cheese as it normally doesn't melt properly but
this cheese from Whole Foods worked very well as you can see in the photograph
above. The taste of the cheese blend was great and I liked the pizza sauce that
Mehdi made. Terri even said it was better than my sauce. I guess I need to work
on that some more.

Next up was the main event:

Let it be known for the record that I hate canned tuna. It smells like
[cat food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTunhRVyREU) and I don't want to
eat cat food. Opened up it looks worse:

Mehdi tried to assure me that a tuna pizza is considered a "safe" pizza in
the same way that a pepperoni pizza is here. Dressed up and ready to go:

About four minutes into the bake I could really smell the tuna. I was
expecting our townhouse to be overrun by cats at any moment. The smell
subsided and had gone away when it was done baking:

Some of the olives went on a few slices for Zineb and Mehdi. Terri and I
tried the olives but they were way to salty for our palette. Mehdi knew
it was going to be a hard sell to get me to try this pizza so he recommended
some of this:

After a drink I was able to build up the courage:

And it wasn't bad. It didn't have a fishy tuna taste. It wasn't bland like
chicken. But it wasn't overpowering. I thought it was going to be completely
gross and that I was going to gag after a bite but that didn't happen. I
could have eaten the entire slice if I wanted to. Terri enjoyed it and
finished her slice. I once thought that tuna pizza was a crazy thing but now
I understand that it could work. Given a choice of going to the dentist or
eating a tuna pizza, I'll take the tuna pizza.

Next up is a pepperoni pizza:

![Pepperoni Before](pep_before.tn.jpg)

We put the pepperoni in the microwave for fifteen seconds to leach out some of
the juice. Out of the oven it looked like this:

![Pepperoni After](pep_after.tn.jpg)

I love those slightly blackened edges on the pepperoni and took those slices.
Terri and Zineb took a break from eating pizza to pose for this photograph:

I made six dough balls and reserved two for later so that left one dough
ball left. Terri requested some cheese sticks so I pulled out the
rolling pin and launched this into the oven:

And came out with these:

A successful pizza day. I tried tuna pizza and I'm around to tell the tale.
