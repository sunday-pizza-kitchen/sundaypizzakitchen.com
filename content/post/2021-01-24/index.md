It is the fourth Sunday of January. I am taking a break from making pizza
this Sunday but I will instead write about the leftover dough from last
week that I used on Tuesday. I ended up eating pizza four days in a row.
I would like to say that I'm feeling tired of pizza but I cannot as I
had leftover [Ledo's pizza](https://ledopizza.com/) for lunch today and it
was good.

The leftover dough was difficult to remove from the plastic container. I'm
not sure if I forgot to oil it down or if the dough ended up being
so sticky that it just didn't want to let go. I was concerned that it was
taking too much effort to remove and that it was going to deform its shape.
I placed it in the pan as soon as it came out of the fridge. I then let it rest
for about 30 minutes and then I was able to easily stretch it out to fill the
entire pan.

I tried to be better with putting on less sauce this time. Instead of two
thick stripes of sauce, I instead went for three thinner stripes. I didn't
bother with shredding the cheese and cubed it instead.

Since the dough was a bit undercooked last time, I used the trick I learned
with the skillet pan pizzas. I put the pan on the stove top
burner for five minutes to let the crust get a head start on cooking.
It looked like this when it was ready for the oven:

The cheese on the edges started to melt at this point and some bubbling
of the olive oil from below can be seen. That may indicate that I need to
use less oil next time. The pizza then went into a 450Â°F oven for the same
15 minutes as before and it came out looking beautiful:

I first thought that I went too light on the sauce as it now looks like it
is drowning in the cheese. I cut this pizza into six slices and pulled off
the first three:

This was an improvement over the last time. The sauce ended up being the
right amount even if it looked lacking. The dough was cooked all the
way through and tasted much better because of that. I took a photo of the
underbelly and that time on the stove top put on a nice crisp:

I only ate half the pizza the first time I made this. This time, I
ate the whole thing because it tasted so good. While it may not be an
actual Detroit-style pizza, cooking any kind of pizza in a Detroit-style
pan works well. I'll be using this pan from now on instead of the cast-iron
skillet. It tastes just as good but the pan is lighter, easier to clean, and
it can be stacked if I purchase more of them.

Next time I do need to make sure the edges don't puff up too much. The cheese
tends to slide down and leave too much of a bare crust around the side. It
might just need some poking with a knife before it hits the oven.

I'm going to have to make a road trip up to Detroit at some point to try
an authentic Detroit-style pizza to see what it is all about.
