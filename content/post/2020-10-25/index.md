It is the fourth Sunday of October. It's time again to try some pan pizza. I
used to love the pan pizza from [Pizza
Hut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZmbovGFyw). I'm talking about the pizza
they served back in the day and not whatever they are selling now. To be
honest, I haven't eaten Pizza Hut in five years since my last disappointment.
My opinions on the subject are now that old and may not reflect what you can
buy today. It has been long enough that I might have to give them another try.

The old pan pizza had a magical quality that made it so special. I think it was
a combination of the charred crust bits and the oily belly. Nobody has this
anymore around here with the exception of [BJ's
Restaurant](https://www.bjsrestaurants.com). Theirs is good when done well but
they can hit or miss.

I've made two pan pizzas previously and that was more than a year ago. I have
notes from the first one saying that the bottom got overcooked and was too
crunchy. I don't have notes from the second one but I remember that one being
too bready and way too thick. My notes did have the [source of the dough
recipe](https://www.foodiewithfamily.com/the-best-pan-pizza-how-why-and-what-to-put-on-it/)
and I notice this time that it credited as a slight modification of the one
provided by [Kenji
LÃ³pez-Alt](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe.html).
I went with the original source this time with no changes.

Niles and the kid were coming over so I prepared the pan dough recipe for two
pizzas along with the standard NY style recipe for an additional three pizzas.
The pan pizza dough is quite sticky once it comes together:

This following photo is how it looked before covering up for the evening. Now
that I'm looking at it, I probably should have mixed it a little more thoroughly.

After sitting out overnight, covered, on the counter top, it puffed up to
this size:

There are some dry spots in there but it turned out to be fine. The no-knead
dough is very fluffy and soft compared to the NY style:

I placed the dough into an oiled cast iron pan and stretched it out a bit
by pressing with my fingertips:

It then sat covered for two hours. I then stretched it out even more to
cover the entire pan:

I put on 100 g of mozzarella to start but it didn't look like enough. I added
20 g more and then put on the Mama Mary's pepperoni:

My previous notes said I first placed the pan on the stove top for 5 minutes
before placing the pan in the oven for 10 minutes. I followed that again
but the pizza looked done after 9 minutes in the over so I pulled it out
a bit early:

I also had in my notes to let it sit for 5 minutes. In both of my previous
bakes, I did not follow that note and ended up burning myself with the hot
oil or with the hot pizza. I set a timer this time to enforce the cool down.

I used a knife to separate the edge from the pan and then with a spatula,
the pizza slid right out.

The crust came out pretty good and it had that classic pan pizza taste to it:

![Crust](pan_crust.tn.jpg)

Always check the under belly to make sure it looks good before removing it
from the pan:

It can always be placed back on the stove top to cook the crust more if
necessary.

This attempt was a success. Niles attended the first attempt last year and
agreed that this one was so much better. Even Terri liked it too. She
still doesn't like the taste of the sauce and they both said that the
pizza could use a bit more cheese. I really liked the pepperoni. It has
some zing so be careful with the crushed red pepper.

Time to move on to the NY style pizza. We decided to increase the cheese a
bit and went with 140 g of mozzarella:

![Extra Cheese](extra_cheese.tn.jpg)

Again there is more blistering than normal and I do think this is because
there was more cheese this time. The extra cheese didn't seem to help and
the pizza just tasted flat compared to the pan pizza. Straight mozzarella
with nothing else going on is just a boring pizza.

That pan pizza is hearty so we were full after two. We made a carry out
order for Mirah which is always with onion:

Which leaves one pan pizza dough and one NY dough left over. I placed both
in plastic containers and will use them for some meals this week.
