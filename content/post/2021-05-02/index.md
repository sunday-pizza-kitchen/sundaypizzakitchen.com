It is the first Sunday in May. Niles had other things going on today but
he said he could be here for pizza if we made it quick. That sounds like
a Ledo's style pizza day to me. Niles hasn't tried it yet so that is an 
added bonus. Let's see what he thinks of it. 

I found some AAA batteries in the drawer and put the new mini-kitchen
scale to good use:

The dough recipe as of right now is:

- 300 g all purpose flour
- 1 packet of Fleischmann's pizza yeast
- 7 g sugar
- 5.5 g salt
- 45 g salted butter
- 150 g water

That is the last packet of the special pizza yeast. Next time I'm going to 
try it with the fast acting yeast and see how that goes. I remembered to
soften the butter this time buy nuking it for 15 seconds or so until it
looked like this:

The dough was drier today than usual when starting out but it finally came 
together nicely. I let the mixer do the hard work today for a good four 
minutes before it took it out and covered it:

I let it sit for fifteen minutes. I then split it into two dough balls
and got working on stretching the first one.

Not too rectangular today, but a knife can always fix that. I draped it 
into the Detroit style pan:

I trimmed the edges and added on some Ledo's sauce. I put some extra on today
because I was feeling quite saucy. That was a bit of dough leftover from 
the trimming.

I played some Tetris with the provolone slices and got some good looking 
coverage there.

From start to oven was 30 minutes. I had the pizza going into the oven right
as Niles and Little T arrived at 1pm. This pizza looks weird while
it is baking. At the half way point when you flip the pan around it is easy to 
think you made mistake. Don't worry, give a few more minutes
and it ends up looking delicious like this:

It looks the the cheese pooled into the center void and it wasn't thick enough
there to avoid burning slightly. Niles really enjoyed it but thought the 
dough had too much butter. I do agree with that one--you could really taste
it it today. Almost like that buttery taste you get with a cookie. 
Little T didn't like it. He had a slice but that was it. The provolone 
didn't work for him. The Wisconsin brick cheese is more his style. 

The other dough ball was used for a pepperoni style pizza with one 
pepperoni per slice:

We scarfed this down pretty quickly. Unlike the Detroit style pizza, these
slices aren't filling. I was still a bit hungry so I combined the scraps from 
the trimmings and rolled out a third dough. It didn't quite cover the pan 
but we made do with what we had:

We then got talking, the pizza was ready, we ate that, and before I knew
what happened, the pizza was devoured and we didn't get a picture. 

The plan for the next time is to tweak the dough recipe and make it a bit
more fluffy and less buttery. And to make more of the dough in case we want
three pizzas. And to do some research by ordering up some more Ledo's pizza.
