It is the third Sunday of December. And one day before the [Great Conjunction
of 2020](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-great-conjunction-of-jupiter-and-saturn).
We haven't had a clear night sky here since last Thursday. Its partly cloudy
out right now and I'm hoping the weather will cooperate for this event.

I asked Niles if he wanted to come over for pizza today but he said that he was
going to be too busy preparing for the Christmas holiday. Even when you are
busy, you still have to eat. I offered to make some pizzas which I could
deliver. He took up the offer for the pizza but came to pick them up
instead. I guess he didn't feel like tipping the delivery driver.

I've used olive oil in the dough. I've used shortening. The last fat to try
is good old butter.

When I used shortening, I put in two tablespoons for 500 g of flour. I
decided to do the same for the butter. I was making up a bigger batch of
dough for today so I put in four tablespoons with 1,000 g of flour. I
nuked it in the microwave for a minute to liquefy but the splattering and
hot bowl shows that I probably should have used a shorter time.

![Butter Liquid](butter_liquid.tn.jpg)

The dough was stickier than normal and I think this was simply due to there
being more liquid with the butter. I dusted it with some flour while kneading
and that was enough to make the dough manageable.

Five pizzas to make today.

![Box Stack](box_stack.tn.jpg)

I opened a package of the skim milk mozzarella and it weighed out to be 476 g.
No blends today and the usual amount of 100 g of cheese per pizza wasn't going
to work. To stretch it out, pizzas with toppings would get 80 g of
cheese while pizzas without toppings would get the full 100 g.

Mise en place for today's bake:

![Toppings](toppings.tn.jpg)

I did buy some new parmesan cheese and sprinkled a bit of that on each
pizza below the the mozzarella. Some say you should never do this. I've seen
plenty of people on YouTube do this. I tried it. It is fine.

The dough yield was perfect for six dough balls at 275 g each. There was a
really small amount of dough left over so I made a super-mini pizza first.

This doesn't take long to cook at all and makes a nice snack to get
started for the day.

![Mini After](mini_after.tn.jpg)

I had both pizza stones in the oven today to help pick up the pace. First up
was Ben's pizza with pepperoni:

![Pizza #1](pizza_1.tn.jpg)

Ben said that it tasted as good as it looked.

Next up were the two pizzas for Niles. One with onions and banana peppers
and one with only cheese. The pizza with toppings went in first and was placed
on the stone at the bottom of the oven:

Niles likes things extra crispy with a side of char so that looked great to
him. To me the crust was burnt on the top. The cheese pizza went in on the top
stone four minutes after the previous pizza was placed on the bottom
stone.

The pizza was pulled out at seven minutes. It looked great on top but appeared
to be undercooked on the bottom. We threw it back in the oven for another
minute to try and improve on that. Niles said it ended up tasting good even
though it didn't have the nice browning underneath. I was too aggressive at
moving fast with these pizzas and I didn't allow enough time for the top stone
to recharge.

A happy customer.

![Pizza To Go](order_to_go.tn.jpg)

The next pizza was for Zach which was pepperoni with light onion and light
black olives. This pizza was placed on the bottom stone:

![Pizza #4](pizza_4.tn.jpg)

Once again, burnt on the one side. I didn't learn my lesson from the previous
pizza. The stone down there is way hotter than I was expecting. I usually flip
the pizza around when there is four minutes remaining on the timer. I should
change that to five and ensure that I spin the pizza a full 180 degrees
especially if there is uneven browning. [Proper
spinning](https://youtu.be/2lTenOTh1V0?t=2495) is the key to success. I took
this pizza instead and reserved the last one for Zach.

I could taste the butter in the pizza crust but it wasn't as pronounced as I
was expecting. Niles said the same thing. There is a huge difference in taste
between a dough with olive oil and a dough with shortening. I'm not so sure
there is much between doughs with olive oil and butter. Or at least with the
quantities that I used. It was interesting but not remarkable. Maybe slathering
the crust with butter would be more effective.

Now it is time for the last pizza and I will pay attention while this one is
baking.

![Pizza #5](pizza_5.tn.jpg)

That one looks so much better. Zach said it tasted great but I left a little too
much flour on the bottom of the crust.

I started baking the pizzas at 12:35pm and finished all five at 1:50pm. Next
time I just need to ensure there is enough time for each stone to recharge and
that I closely watch the pizzas being baked on the bottom stone.
