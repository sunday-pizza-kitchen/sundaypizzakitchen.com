It is the first Sunday of December. During the week Niles talked to somebody in
the 'Bury who worked at [Ponzetti's](https://www.facebook.com/ponzettis/) way
back in the day. He drilled him for information and was able to confirm that
the pizza sauce is from [Don
Pepino](https://www.bgfoods.com/brands/don-pepino/product/pizza-sauce) but with
some additional seasoning and thinned out with some water. He also found out
that the fat added to the pizza dough is shortening.

I've never bought shortening before. I think the only time I used
it was in Boy Scouts and I think we were frying something in the actual Crisco
can. That was so long ago I cannot recall the details. It may not have even
been food that we were frying.

I wasn't sure how much shortening to use in the dough but a quick survey on the
Internet indicated that two tablespoons was probably good for 500 g of flour. I
measured out the amount and placed it in a small bowl. I also wasn't sure of
the best way to add it to the dough so I decided to nuke it for a minute until
it was melted. It was so clear that it is hard to even see it in the
photograph.

![Criso Liquid](crisco_liquid.tn.jpg)

I normally measure the water and olive oil together in the same cup and
then dump them into the dry ingredients. Why not do the same
thing here? I let the shortening cool a bit but when it hit the water it
solidified immediately in a dramatic science experiment kind of way.

I mixed that the best I could and continued to make the dough. I'm not sure
if that was a good thing or a bad thing to do.

We used the Pepino sauce as-is when making the sheet pan pizza. It is a chunky
sauce and is too think to pour. The next pizza day we watered it down a bit
to where we were able to make some sauce swirls. Niles had heard that the
Ponzetti's ratio is one can of sauce to one can of water. We tried that for
the first pizza.

The first pizza was a disaster.

![Soupy Before](soupy_before.tn.jpg)

The sauce was way too thin. I didn't try to put this much on but it sort of
jumped out of the container as I poured the sauce. You can see some islands of
white where we tried to compensate by adding more cheese. It kind of looked
like a can of SpaghettiOs. There was so much sauce that if you passed out on
this pizza, there would be good chance that you [would
drown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCgYMFtxUUw&t=69).

We should have cut our losses at this point and tossed it out. We were
stubborn and continued anyway. It was so watery that when the pizza
hit the oven, a tidal wave formed, raced across the surface, and crested over
the crust towards the rear.

The tidal wave then receded under the crust. When the pizza was pulled out,
it left part of the underbelly behind where it fused with the stone:

The stone got pulled out of the oven right after this photo. That amount of
burn was enough to set off the [smoke detector](https://youtu.be/P_BCnoVeYcA).
We put in the other pizza stone and let it come up to temperature for about
twenty minutes. The final product was a bit of a mess:

We cut some slices out of the good side of the pizza and took some bites. The
sauce was so watered down that it lost most of its flavor. It tasted like sauce
you would find on an [Ellio's pizza](https://ellios.com/product/cheese-pizza/).
The dough had a different taste and it was definitely the taste we were looking
for. Little T ate all of this pizza that we put on his plate. He didn't even
pull off the cheese this time. Maybe because he couldn't find the cheese in all
the sauce.

The carcass of that pizza looked like this:

I have a backup can of sauce for incidents like this. I also have a [backup for
the
backup](https://www.si.com/nhl/2020/02/23/emergency-backup-goalie-david-ayres-hurricanes-win)
which is a can of Classico pizza sauce. We reduced the water to a half and the
consistency looked much better.

![Thicker Sauce](thicker_sauce.tn.jpg)

This time the swirl kept its form:

Out of the oven:

![Swirl After](swirl_after.tn.jpg)

This ended up being too much sauce but it actually had some flavor this time.
We added some additional spices and some sugar, but at one and a half
tablespoons, the sugar made the sauce too sweet. Next time we will try less.

For the last pizza of the day we used less sauce and this was the best of
the afternoon:

![Pizza #3](pizza_3.tn.jpg)

This pizza was overcooked on one side and undercooked on the other. I did
flip this pizza around at four minutes. I guess I flipped it all the way
around? Terri and Zach came home while we were eating this pizza and they each
tried a small slice. Terri really liked the crust made with the shortening
but agreed that we had added too much to the sauce.

Our experiments from today are showing some good results in the quest for
a homemade Ponzetti's Pizza. We aren't there yet but making good progress.
