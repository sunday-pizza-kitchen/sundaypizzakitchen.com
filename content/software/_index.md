The information below is what I am currently using for the pizza recipes. Some
things may be great, others may be wrong. Always subject to change. I am not an
expert but I am having fun trying to figure things out.

## Dough 

The dough recipe I'm using is from Frank Pinollo found in the following video:

[![How-To: Make Homemade Pizza with Frank Pinello](https://img.youtube.com/vi/whnvQBhXh3A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnvQBhXh3A)

He also has a whole series called "The Pizza Show". Watch them all.  

By weights, the recipe is:

- 1,000 g all-purpose flour
- 20 g kosher salt
- 10 g extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp active dry yeast 
- 650 g water 

Yield: 6 dough balls, each around 275 g

I did make a modification by reducing the amount of yeast by a half. The dough
would be a bit puffy. When doing a batch of six, the last dough ball would be
blown out to the point it was difficult to work with. Half the yeast gives the
dough a longer room temperature life with still a good rise. Six does seem to be the limit for me when making pizza. More than that requires letting the dough come up to room temperature in shifts.

My dad is a fan of the King Arthur flour so that is what I have been using. It
has treated me well so far and I keep buying that brand. Early in the pandemic
when everything was hard to find Terri managed to grab some Gold Medal flour.
At that point flour was probably harder to find than gold itself. That worked
well too.

Place all the dry goods in a large bowl and stir until well combined. Roll up
your sleeves, take off any rings, dump the liquids in, and start mixing. Resist
the temptation to add more water. It is going to feel very dry at first but it
should get wetter as you go along. As soon as there in no longer any dry flour
in the bowl, stop. Cover the bowl and let it sit for 30 minutes.

Knead the dough for 10 minutes. If it becomes too wet and starts sticking to
the surface, add a touch of flour, and continue kneading. Place the dough in an
oiled bowl, cover, and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

Take the dough out of the fridge 2 hours before baking time. Divide the dough,
make individual dough balls, and place on a floured sheet pan. Cover the sheet
pan which I usually do by using another inverted sheet pan.

Half of the recipe is:

- 500 g all-purpose flour
- 10 g kosher salt
- 5 g extra virgin olive oil
- Â½ tsp active dry yeast 
- 325 g water 

I am really bad when it comes to halving recipes in my head. No matter how many
times I keep repeating, "half, half, half", I usually end up forgetting to
halve one of the ingredients. Which is why I have listed it here. I also made
sure to put enough text between the full and half versions to ensure that both
aren't displayed on my phone screen at the same time.
