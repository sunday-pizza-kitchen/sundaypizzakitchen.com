You don't need a bunch of fancy equipment to make pizza. Here is what I'm using
at the moment:

## Oven and Stone

This is the oven that we have in our kitchen and it makes some great pizzas:

![Oven](oven.tn.jpg)

I crank up the oven to its maximum temperature of 550°F and it also has a
convection setting which I turn on. A 12" pizza at this temperature takes about
7 minutes too bake for a plain pizza or when using dry toppings. I goes up to
around 8 minutes when using wet veggies.

It takes a full 30 minutes for the oven to reach that temperature and then I
let the pizza stone pre-heat for an additional hour. So the oven goes on 90
minutes before the first launch. Plan ahead and start that oven early.

Over the holidays I made a lot of pizza at Terri's parents house for dinner one
night. Their oven only gets up to 500°F and doesn't have a fancy convection
setting. The pizzas still came out great but it may have taken slightly longer
to bake.

If you are baking a lot of pizza, two stones helps things go faster. Alternate
baking between the two stones instead of baking two at once. They need some
time to recharge the heat after a pizza comes off. If you try to bake pizzas
back-to-back on the same stone, the crust underneath won't bake properly and
will disappoint.

My father gave me that stone. I asked him where he got it but he could not
remember. I've known two people who used stones that cracked when baking 
at a full blast temperature. If that happens, just buy a beefier stone. 

## Scale

You don't need a scale, but I started using one at the very beginning of this
pizza journey. We already had one in the house and I find it much easier to
measure using it.

There is nothing fancy about it. It's not accurate enough for yeast but
everything else seems fine. I might add a smaller scale at some point in the
future.

## Peel 

You need some way to launch the pizza in the oven and some way to pull the
pizza out of the oven. I started with this peel that my father gave me:

![Metal Peel](metal.tn.jpg)

It is great for pulling out the pizza. It is also great for rotating the pizza. 
It is not great for launching the pizza. I tried for a bit but it was just
more of a hassle than it was worth. It was just too easy to get that pizza
stuck and not wanting to move. As Brad Leone says, ["it can sense your fear"](https://youtu.be/Yan892RXh5A?t=1390). The solution is to also buy a wooden peel:

Sprinkle down a little semolina flour on the peel before putting down the
dough. It should slide off nicely every time. If you only want to buy a single
peel, get the wooden one. You can always use tongs to rotate and pull out the
pizza if needed.

## Dough Scraper 

I highly recommend one of these:

A small film of dough can develop on the surface you are working on. Use this
to easily scrape that, or any other foreign particles found, off of your
counter top. And it is also great for cutting the dough to portion it into
separate balls.

## Pizza Cutter 

Yes, you could use a knife. But if you are making pizza from scratch, you 
need to impress your friends with your pizza cutter skills. This is a cheap
one so when I cut, it doesn't look so skillful.

## Pans

I picked these up at the [Sysco Cash and Carry](http://www.syscodiscountfoodcenter.com/):

I didn't plan on getting these. I just happened to be browsing the aisles there
and came across them. In the same aisle they have peels, screens, and drinkware
that makes you nostalgic for the in-room Pizza Hut dining experience. 

## Shakers

These are also available at the Sysco Cash and Carry. Niles, Mac, and I were
adamant that pizza must rated using a cheese pizza. The only toppings allowed
are on the table. These are those toppings:
