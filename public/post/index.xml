      <description>It is the last Sunday of September. Niles is out of town this weekend so I made a small batch of dough which normally yields three dough balls. I decided to do some cheese blend testing and instead portioned the dough into a single 280 g ball for a 12 inch pizza and then four balls each at 135 g for the various blends.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been bouncing between 270g, 275g, and 280g for the 12 inch pizza and I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to the higher side for now.</description>
