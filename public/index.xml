      <description>It is the first Sunday of October. I decided to make two pizza sauces for today. All the ingredients were the same except that in the first sauce I used Cento San Marzano tomatoes. At the Giant these cost around $4 per can. On the label it says, &amp;ldquo;Product of Italy&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if that means the tomatoes were actually grown in Italy or not. It then says &amp;ldquo;Pomodoro San Marzano&amp;rdquo; right below that to sound more authentic.</description>

      <description>It is the last Sunday of September. Niles is out of town this weekend so I made a small batch of dough which normally yields three dough balls. I decided to do some cheese blend testing and instead portioned the dough into a single 280 g ball for a 12 inch pizza and then four balls each at 135 g for the various blends.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been bouncing between 270 g, 275 g, and 280 g for the 12 inch pizza and I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to the higher side for now.</description>
